LucidScroll is a lightweight plugin and is very easy to use...

First step is to upload the lucid.js file to the server.
Then this would need to be pasted in between the <head></head> tags of the document :

	<script src="file-directory/jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="file-directory/lucid.js"></script>

	<script>
	$(window).on('load', function() {
	$(this).impulse();
	});
	</script>

Making sure to also use the jQuery library (the first line) if it's not already linked to and to change the file paths to the appropriate directory.
If the document is not HTML5, type="text/javascript" would have to be added to the script tags.

That's it! The page should now be good for smooth scrolling.

Most settings can be tested beforehand on the special console available here :

Note for using the plugin with the appended special easing - if the 'swing' animation type is required, this should be altered to 'curve'.
